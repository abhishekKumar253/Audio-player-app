## Overview
The "React Audio Player" is a web application that allows users to upload audio files (e.g., mp3) and create playlists. The application utilizes built-in Browser APIs to store the audio files locally. Users can view and interact with a playlist, including a "now playing" view that displays the currently playing audio file. The standard HTML audio player is employed for playback, and users can seamlessly transition to the next file in the playlist upon completion.
